Note
Section 6, Lecture 102

There's currently a bug with the Nominatim object which we use in the next video. To fix that please change these lines:

    from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
    nom = Nominatim()

to these:

    from geopy.geocoders import GoogleV3
    nom = GoogleV3(scheme = "http")

The rest of the code remains the same.
